# HomeRepos

HomeRepos is a home for your personal git repos. It aims to be a fairly
lightweight solution for providing a web browsing interface for personal
projects.


## Features

* Personal and public repositories
* Per-account read/write access of repos
* `git pull` and `git push` via HTTP


## Dependencies

* Ruby (ideally installed via rbenv or RVM)
* PostgreSQL


## Development

To setup your development environment, run `bin/setup` and `bin/setup_tests`.

To run tests, run `bin/rails test` and `bin/rails test:system`.


## Contributing

I'd really appreciate contributions! But I'll probably be pretty strict about
what features I add and what PRs I accept. Please create an issue to discuss
features before working on anything too large!

If you do make a PR, please

* Squash your commits
* Add an appropriate amount of tests
* Write a good commit message
